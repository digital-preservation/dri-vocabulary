#The National Archives Linked Data Vocabularies

This repository contains two vocabularies:
- The [UK National Archives Metadata Vocabulary](metadata)
- The [Digital Records Infrastructure Catalogue Vocabulary](terms)

These are [OWL](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) vocabularies which can be viewed and manipulated using the [Protege](http://protege.stanford.edu/) software from Stanford.
